**Technologies and Tools** - Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

**Goal:** To prepare Market Research on Los Angeles restaurants.

**Project Description**

You’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so you and your partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will you be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
You’re an analytics guru, so your partners have asked you to prepare some market research. You have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

## Overall Conclusion

Make a presentation of your research to share with investors.

## Recommendations

Based on our research, we recommend opening a small cafe.

The optimal number of seats is 25-30.

The cafe must be located on one of the five most popular streets - W PICO BLVD, W SUNSET BLVD, W WESTERN AVE, SANTA MONICA BLVD and WILSHIRE BLVD. It is also worth finding a place so that there are shopping centers or business centers nearby. This will attract new visitors and increase the number of native ads to promote the cafe.

We recommend that you pay attention to the possibility of a social project to attract people with disabilities as people who control robots in a cafe.

ROBOT•RUN Cafe will be the world's most advanced cafe system with best-in-class sanitation, performance and menu variety.
