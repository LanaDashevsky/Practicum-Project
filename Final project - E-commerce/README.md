# E-commerce Project Description
This is the main final project for the practical data analyst course.

For this project, we had almost no terms of reference, so we had to study the data ourselves and decide for ourselves what we can provide from this analysis. The structure for it was developed during the decomposition stage and is stored in a separate Jupyter notebook. In addition, we have prepared several dashboards for work and a presentation.

## Description of the data:

The dataset contains the transaction history of an online store that sells household goods.

The file `ecommerce_dataset_us.csv` contains the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo` — order identifier
- `StockCode` — item identifier
- `Description` — item name
- `Quantity`
- `InvoiceDate` — order date
- `UnitPrice` — price per item
- `CustomerID`

### Project structure:

1. General lookup. Taking a look at the datasets and making a plan for data preprocessing.
2. Data Preprocessing. Treating missing values, duplicates, and other data anomalies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis. Studying the data at hands.
4. Categorization of product description.
5. RFM model for customers. Customer segmentation model used in marketing to analyze customer behavior and value.
6. Apriory Algorithm. Analyze customer purchasing behavior and product associations in a transaction database.
7. Statistical Data Analysis. Performing statistical hypotheses testing.
8. Overall conclusion and recommendations for business.
