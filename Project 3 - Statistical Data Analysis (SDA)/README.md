# Project 3 - Telecom Operator

**Technologies and Tools** - Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly,  Scipy

**Goal:** The main goal of the project is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

**Project Description**

You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

## Overall Conclusion

* We saw that 90% of Surf tariff users go beyond the tariff plan and use additional services above the tariff - in a third of cases by calls, in a quarter - by messages and in more than half of cases via the Internet traffic.
* The average revenue under the Surf tariff significantly exceeds the subscription fee.
* Users of the Ultimate tariff have high limits on messages and minutes of calls, and according to the sample, they rarely approach the thresholds. The Internet traffic limit is also high, it was exceeded only in 5.6% of cases.
* Users of the Ultimate tariff only in 10% of cases exceeded the monthly fee.
* From our data, it looks like the Surf tariff plan is not very convenient for most users, since people have much more needs for Internet traffic, calls and messages than the tariff offers. It is possible that the Megaline operator should revise this package - raise the limits and increase the cost of the monthly fee.
* The hypothesis test showed that the average revenue from users of the Surf tariff is not equal to the Ultimate, so we had to reject the null hypothesis.
* Testing the second hypothesis that the average revenue from users in the NY-NJ region is equal to the average revenue from other regions - we cannot reject it, despite a slight difference from the critical significance level of 5%. We must say that the average user revenue of the NY-NJ area is equal to other regions.
